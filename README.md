# Lower Or Higher Youtube

This project is simnilar to [The Higher Or Lower](https://www.higherlowergame.com/) game but instead of Google Searches, it uses YouTube videos. It was available online, but not anymore because it costs money.

The goal is to show the most popular videos in each country. In order to do so there's a scheduled job that fetches the videos every day and stores them in a database. The frontend then makes a request to the backend to get the videos for a specific country which will be used to play the game.

The YouTube video is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJVYuKRqeIc).
